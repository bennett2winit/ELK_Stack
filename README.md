# ELK_Stack
This is one of the projects produced in my Cybersecurity Bootcamp

It includes a compilation of BASH scripts, YAML files, and network diagrams previously created during assignments

The ansible scripts were used to create an elk stack server

The linux script was used to take time variable and find a correlation based on a schedule in a mock game of roulette. This was intended to "catch" perpetrators if a large number of unusual occurances happened during their shift

The network diagram shows a series of virtual machines containers and a load balancer created in azure labs
